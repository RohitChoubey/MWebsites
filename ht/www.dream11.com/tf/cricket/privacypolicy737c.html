<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Last updated: 18th December, 2016</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Dream11 Fantasy Private Limited operates the portal in India, which offers cricket, football and kabaddi fantasy games and other online fantasy sports games through the web-portal dream11.com and associated Facebook application, partner website(s) and mobile application(s) (collectively referred to as the “<strong>Portal</strong>”) (Dream11 Fantasy Private Limited referred to herein as “<strong>Dream11</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>” “<strong>our</strong>”).</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Any person utilizing the Portal (“<strong>User</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”) or any of its features including participation in the various contests, games (including fantasy games ("<strong>Game</strong>") (“<strong>Amusement Facilities</strong>”) being conducted on the Portal) shall be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Dream11 respects the privacy of its Users and is committed to protect it in all respects. With a view to offer an enriching and holistic internet experience to its Users, Dream11 offers a vast repository of Amusement Facilities. Kindly take time to read the 'About Us' section to know more about Dream11. Most of the Amusement Facilities are offered for free but you may need registration to participate in Dream11's online games. The information about the User is collected by Dream11 as (i) information supplied by Users and (ii) information automatically tracked during User's navigation on Dream11.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Before you submit any information to the Portal, please read this Privacy Policy for an explanation of how we will treat your personal information. By using any part of the Portal, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and to the collection, processing and maintenance of this information.

While you have the option not to provide us with certain information or withdraw consent to collect certain information, kindly note that in such an event you may not be able to take full advantage of the entire scope of features and services offered to you and we reserve the right not to provide you with our services.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15"><strong>Purpose and Usage:</strong></p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">To avail certain Amusement Facilities on the Portal, Users would be required to provide certain information for the registration process namely:</p>

<p class="lh18 pdTop15">In the course of providing the Amusement Facilities, Users may invite other existing Users or other users (“<strong>Invited Users</strong>”) to participate in any of the Amusement Facilities by providing the email address or Facebook username of such users. Dream11 may thereafter use this information to contact the Invited User and invite such user to register with Dream11 (if such Invited User is not a existing User) and participate in the Game/Amusement Facility in relation to which such person was invited by the User. The participation of the Invited User in any of the Amusement Facilities shall be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions (https://www.dream11.com/tf/cricket/termsandconditions) for the use of the Portal. The User hereby represents that the Invited Users have consented and agreed to such disclosure to and use of their email address and Facebook username by Dream11.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">All required information is specific and based on the kind of Game/ Amusement Facility the User wishes to participate in or access, and will be utilized for the purpose of providing services, including but not limited to the Amusement Facility, requested by the User. The information as supplied by the Users enables us to improve the Amusement Facilities and provide you the most user-friendly game experience. Dream11 may also share such information with affiliates and third parties in limited circumstances, including for the purpose of providing services requested by the User, complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15"><strong>Disclosure/Sharing:</strong></p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Dream11 may also share information as provided by you and data concerning usage of the Amusement Facility and participation in the Games with third party service providers engaged by Dream11, for the purpose of data analytics or other similar purposes, for the purpose of storage, improving the services and helping Dream11 serve you better.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Where we propose to use your personal information (that is, information that that may be used to identify the User and that is not otherwise publicly available) for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">By using the Portal, you hereby expressly agree and grant consent to the collection, use and storage of this information by Dream11. Dream11 reserves the right to share, disclose and transfer information collected hereunder with its own affiliates. In the event Dream11 sells or transfers all or a portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are shared, disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction.

<p class="lh18 pdTop15"><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong></p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Dream11 has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Dream11’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Dream11 does not control.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Dream11's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Dream11 uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Dream11's visitors come.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15"><strong>Links:</strong></p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">Dream11 also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Dream11's control. Once the User leaves Dream11's servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Dream11's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. Dream11 is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15"><strong>Security Procedures:</strong></p>
<p class="lh18 pdTop15">All information gathered on Dream11 is securely stored within Dream11- controlled database.

However, we understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Further, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with Internet access.

Our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, how we store it and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
